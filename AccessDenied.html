	<title>Fix for access denied to administrative shares</title>
</head>

<body>
	<div>
		<p>
		Under certain circumstances, you cannot connect to administrative shares (e.g. C$) on
		remote computers, even though you use the right credentials. Accessing a normal
		(i.e. non-administrative) share works flawlessly, though.
		</p>

		<h3>Problem</h3>

		<p>
		In this situation you get the following error when trying to connect to the admin share in Explorer:
		</p>

		<p><img width=572 height=214 alt="" src="images/image001.jpg"></p>

		<p>The message hints at multiple connections, but that is misleading.</p>

		<p>When you try to connect to the admin share on the command line, you get a different error message:</p>

		<p style="padding: 10px 20px; background-color:lightgrey;">
		C:\&gt;&nbsp;net use \\192.168.175.129\c$ /user:win7-2\admin *<br />
		Type the password for \\192.168.175.129\c$:<br />
		System error 5 has occurred.<br />
		&nbsp;<br />
		Access is denied.
		</p>

		<h3>Solution</h3>

		<p>
		As described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951016">MS KB article 951916</a>, 
		Microsoft introduced as part of UAC a little known feature called "UAC remote restrictions". 
		It filters the access token for connections made with local user accounts or Microsoft accounts (the
		latter typically have the format <i>MicrosoftAccount\EMailAddress</i>). In
		other words, it removes the SID for "Administrators". Connections made with
		domain accounts remain unchanged.</p>

		<p>
		From KB951016: <br /><br />
		If the user wants to administer the workstation with a Security Account Manager (SAM)
		account, the user must interactively log on to the computer that is to be
		administered with Remote Assistance or Remote Desktop, if these services are available.
		</p>

		<p>
		One may like this or not, the solution is luckily pretty simple. UAC remote restrictions can
		be disabled by setting the registry value LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy to 1:
		</p>

		<p style="padding: 10px 20px; background-color:lightgrey;">
		Key:&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System<br />
		Value: LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy<br />
		Data:&nbsp; 1 (to disable, 0 enables filtering)<br />
		Type:&nbsp; REG_DWORD (32-bit)<br />
		</p>

		<p>
		After a reboot access tokens from remote connections are not filtered any more. On
		Windows 8 and Windows 10 the reboot is not even required any more.
